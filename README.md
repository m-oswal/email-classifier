# ðŸ“§ Email Classification System using Machine Learning and Gmail API

This project is an intelligent email classification system that automatically categorizes incoming emails into three labels:

- **No Need to Read**
- **Important**
- **Urgent**

It uses a combination of supervised machine learning (binary classification) and rule-based logic for urgency detection. The model is integrated with the **Gmail API** to fetch emails, classify them, and apply labels directly in your inbox.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Fetches unread emails using Gmail API
- NLP-based feature extraction from subject, sender, and body
- Machine learning classifier to filter non-relevant emails
- Rule-based urgency detection for deadline-sensitive messages
- Applies labels automatically: `NoNeedToRead`, `Important`, `Urgent`
- Logging of classifications for analysis
